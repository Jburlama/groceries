# Groceries

I Have Tres places where I can buy groceries, so I made a web app, so I can figure out which place would be cheaper to buy.

With this project, I could practice multiple programming and problem-solving skills, including data scraping, designing and migrating a relational database, python scripting, and creating an interface with a pleasant user experience

The technologies used were:
Python, Django, sqlite3 - for the backend
HTMX - for the front end. 



[!NOTE]
The database and images are not included in this repo
