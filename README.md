# Groceries

I Have Tres places where I can buy groceries, so I made a web app, so I can figure out which place would be cheaper to buy.

With this project, I could practice multiple programming and problem-solving skills, including data scraping, designing and migrating a relational database, python scripting, and creating a dynamic interface with a pleasant user experience

The technologies used were:

Python, Django, sqlite3 - for the backend

HTMX - for the front end.
